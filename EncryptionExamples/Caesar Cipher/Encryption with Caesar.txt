Encryption - changing how information looks to ward off unwanted resipiants, or hackers, from reading it.

How long has it been around?
Thousands of years! See: Caesar Cipher

How does it work?
There are many different types of encryption, but the most common is called symmetric encryption. 
This is where the sender and receiver both have the same key, or password, to encrypt and decrypt the message. 
The sender encrypts the message, and the receiver decrypts it. The key is the same for both of them.

For example if the encryption key is 3, then the letter A would become D, B would become E, and so on.
A -> D
B -> E
C -> F
D -> G
...
W -> Z
X -> A
Y -> B
Z -> C
and so on...

Here's an example:
message   - "Hello World"
key       -       3
encrypted - "Khoor Zruog"

Modern industry standard encryption for the internet is called AES, aka Advanced Encryption Standard
                                                            or RSA, aka Rivest-Shamir-Adleman
