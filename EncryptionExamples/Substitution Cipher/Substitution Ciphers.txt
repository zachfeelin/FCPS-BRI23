Substitution Ciphers
"Arbitrary" Substitution
We can define the cipher to transform any symbol into another symbol.

For example, we can define the cipher to transform the letter "a" into the letter "d", the letter "b" into the letter "q", and so on. 
This is called an arbitrary substitution cipher. The following is an example of an arbitrary substitution cipher:
A -> D
D -> A
...
B -> Q
C -> E
E -> B
Q -> C
...
Z -> Z
& -> &

This isn't giberish, it still has a pattern to decrypt it. We still need to make sure that each letter is only used exactly once.
